# Matlab-Phaser
This is the MATLAB code for a phaser effect that was converted into C for use on an OMAP - L138 evaluation board.

Open "final_code_varying.m" in MATLAB and hit "Run." Make sure "notch.m" is in the same folder, as the function in the file will be called in "final_code_varying.m."

You will see a plot of the LFO and a plot of the notch filter operating between specified frequencies of the LFO.
